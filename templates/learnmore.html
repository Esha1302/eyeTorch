            <p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. Damages in the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the retina make DR. Diabetic retinopathy is one of the causes of blindness among working-age adults. Approximately four hundred and twenty million people worldwide have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. The universality of this disease has doubled in the past 20 years especially in Asia. Approximately one-third are expected to be diagnosed with DR, a chronic eye disease that can cause <b>vision loss</b>. For correct treatment and to prevent visual loss, DR stage classification based on the extremity is very important. Regular screening of diabetic patients for DR is a cost-effective and important aspect of their care. The accuracy and timing of this care are of significant importance to both the cost and effectiveness of treatment. If detected early enough, effective treatment of DR is available, making this a vital process. Based on the Study of the <b>Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy</b>, DR can be classified into <b>five stages</b>. The first stage is the Normal stage, second Mild NPDR (NPDR stands for None-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy), the third stage is Moderate NPDR, the fourth stage is Severe NPDR, and the fifth stage is PDR (Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy).
